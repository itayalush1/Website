I listen to A LOT of music. And in doing that I end up discovering a lot of music too, and sharing the stuff I listen to with other people is always fun so i’m gonna try to post something like this every once in a while to give out some good music recommendations lol

Starting off with an artist I found only two weeks ago that I became completely obsessed with is Dayglow. He makes alternative rock that just makes the listener… happy. His music is so hopeful, and generally just charming. Let’s pick apart some of his tracks.
## Dayglow

Can I call you tonight - This song is about a guy who’s not sure what he’s feeling, seemingly towards someone he knows. This theme seems like something you’d write a sad song about, but not with Dayglow! Sloan, the guy who writes performs, and produces the songs, somehow manages to make an extremely danceable, hopeful and cheerful track out of something seemingly sad. This theme of cheerfulness out of sadness continues with Close To You, a track from his new album, Harmony House. This track is about a guy who’s in love with a girl, but is stuck in a sort of limbo between action and inaction on his feelings. He second guesses himself and decides not to make his feelings known to the person he’s interested in, but on the other hand not speaking about his feelings drives him mad. Again, this setting seems sad but Sloan manages to make one of the most bright, cheerful, and fun to listen to tracks out of it. This is what I love about Dayglow. Sloan’s ability to take sadness and turning it into hopefulness and cheerfulness is something truly special and it shows in his music. If want a quick mood booster, Dayglow’s tracks are a great place to turn to. I’d suggest you listen to his albums start to finish one by one, there are only two and I promise you won’t regret it :)

## Månskin

Next up, in a surprise to basically no one, are Månskin. Everyone knows them by this point - the Italian rock band that won the Eurovision 2021 contest and put rock back on the charts. They have been covered extensively by people far more qualified than me but they are always fun to discuss imo. Their Eurovision contest entry, ZITTY E BOUNI, is absolutely amazing imo. I think the singer, Damiano David, does an astonishing job. His vocals are simply amazing, and the rest of the band fits in really well. Their songs rock, and it’s always fun to see rock music go mainstream. Månskin were a pleasant surprise, and they’ll stay in my playlist for a while.

## Verdena

Listening to a lot of Månskin caused the Spotify algorithm to start recommending me Italian rock, and so I found Verdena. As of yet they have released 6 full length albums. Their style goes all the way from soft ballads to harder rock songs, which I always love to see - diverse bands are great fun. Their top track on Spotify, “Trovami un modo semplice per uscirne” (long name, ik lmao) which translates to “Find me an easy way out” is a kind of soft, more accoustic song that is quite fun. Another track I loved, Muori Delay, hits way harder, in a more grunge-esque style which as a fan of the genre I always like to hear - and it works surprisingly well in Italian. I’d suggest you give them a listen; while not for everyone they make some interesting music and it’s great to put in the background, too.

## Honorable Mention

Last but not least, an honorable mention of sorts, is Suspect208. This band is very young - they were formed in the midst of the pandemic and released their first track NICOTINE, in January of this year. To put it shortly, they make some really great rock music, and really I think their tracklist is so short you really should just give them a listen and see for yourself. Definitely put this band on your watch list - should be interesting to see what they come up with next. An album perhaps?

Well if you made it this far into my long nerdy rant about music you probably are interested in it in some way or another so here are a couple links to get you going:
